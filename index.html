          <h2>MISSILE MAN OF INDIA</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>
            (15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist
            and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to
            2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied
            physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as
            a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
            Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
            Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
            civilian space programme and military missile development
            efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for
            his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
